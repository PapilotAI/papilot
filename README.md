</div>

Papilot is a local workspace for writing and revising LaTeX papers with AI agents. Mark up passages and equations on the PDF, let an agent edit a separate copy of the source, then review the typeset changes and choose which ones to keep.

## Features

<h3>Annotate the PDF</h3>
Select a sentence or box an equation and say what should change. Group related notes by color to give several passages one instruction.

Compare the typeset pages before and after, including changes elsewhere such as renumbered equations. Accept, reject, or comment on each edit, and undo decisions as you review.

Each new task works on its own copy of the paper. Once reviewed, apply accepted edits to your working directory or commit them to a separate <code>papilot/…</code> branch.

Stage and commit files, pull, and push from the workspace. An agent can draft commit messages and help resolve merge conflicts; the commit graph shows each task’s worktree.

- **[Skills](docs/guide.md#skills) and [attachments](docs/guide.md#task-attachments):** Run `/` skills to polish prose, proofread, or check math, define custom skills in Settings, and attach reference files or images to tasks and messages.
- **Reading and workspace:** Navigate manuscripts with the PDF table of contents and full-text search, with light and dark themes and an English or Chinese interface.

## Quick start

Papilot requires **Node.js 22.22+**, **Git**, and a full **TeX** distribution with `latexmk` and `synctex` ([MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) or [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)). Revising a paper also requires at least one configured [agent](#agents).

```sh
npm install -g papilot
papilot demo
```

Open [http://127.0.0.1:7274](http://127.0.0.1:7274) and select **Manuscript** in the sidebar to explore the bundled example paper.

To work on your own manuscript, run `papilot` and choose **Add paper…** to open a local LaTeX folder or ZIP archive. Papilot looks for the main `.tex` file, prepares Git history when needed, and attempts compilation. If the main file is ambiguous or the build fails, the import dialog helps you choose a file or fix the problem.

Check your setup in **Settings → Runtime**, under **Agents** or **LaTeX**. Run `papilot doctor` for environment checks, or `papilot doctor --repo /path/to/paper` to check a manuscript too ([diagnostics](docs/guide.md#diagnostics)).

You can choose an agent and model for each task. Depending on the integration, Papilot runs agents using their local CLI sign-in or provider API credentials you supply, without storing your keys.

Open **Settings → Runtime → Agents** to check status, models, and setup instructions (such as `papilot codex login`). Click **Reconnect** after installing or signing in to an agent while Papilot is running, or restart `papilot` after changing environment variables. See the [agent guide](docs/guide.md#agents) for per-agent requirements and capabilities.
